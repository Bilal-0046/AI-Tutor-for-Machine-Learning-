Web content classification:To classify information on web pages by assigning relevant labels would require a massive staff of human capital due to the billions of websites that exist and offer all kinds of material. To enhance user experience, many forms of semi-supervised learning are employed to annotate and categorize web material.\n3. Text document classification:Making a text document classifier is another case where semi-supervised learning has been effective. The technique works well in this case since it is quite challenging for human annotators to read through several texts that are wordy in order to assign a simple label, such as a kind or genre.\nExample:\nA text document classifier is a typical illustration of a semi-supervised learning application. In this kind of case, it would be almost impossible to obtain a significant quantity of labeled text documents, making semi-supervised learning the ideal choice. Simply said, it would take too much time to have someone read through complete text documents just to categorize them.\nIn these kinds of situations,semi-supervised semi-supervised algorithms help by learning from a tiny labeled text document data set to recognize a huge amount of unlabeled text document data set in the training set."

Here are some of the most common types of supervised learning algorithms:\nLinear Regression:Linear regression is a type of supervised learning regression algorithm that is used to predict a continuous output value. It is one of the simplest and most widely used algorithms in supervised learning.\nLogistic Regression: Logistic regression is a type of supervised learning classification algorithm that is used to predict a binary output variable.\nDecision Trees: Decision tree is a tree-like structure that is used to model decisions and their possible consequences. Each internal node in the tree represents a decision, while each leaf node represents a possible outcome.\nRandom Forests: Random forests again are made up of multiple decision trees that work together to make predictions. Each tree in the forest is trained on a different subset of the input features and data. The final prediction is made by aggregating the predictions of all the trees in the forest.\nSupport Vector Machine(SVM):The SVM algorithm creates a hyperplane to segregate n-dimensional space into classes and identify the correct category of new data points. The extreme cases that help create the hyperplane are called support vectors, hence the name Support Vector Machine.\nK-Nearest Neighbors:KNN works by finding k training examples closest to a given input and then predicts the class or value based on the majority class or average value of these neighbors. The performance of KNN can be influenced by the choice of k and the distance metric used to measure proximity.\nGradient Boosting:Gradient Boosting combines weak learners, like decision trees, to create a strong model. It iteratively builds new models that correct errors made by previous ones.\nNaive Bayes Algorithm:The Naive Bayes algorithm is a supervised machine learning algorithm based on applying Bayes' Theorem with the “naive” assumption that features are independent of each other given the class label.\nLet's summarize the supervised machine learning algorithms in table:\nThese types of supervised learning in machine learning vary based on the problem we're trying to solve and the dataset we're working with.

SVMs try to find the hyperplane in a high-dimensional space that maximally separates different classes or output values.\nKernels:SVR can use different types of kernels, which are functions that determine the similarity between input vectors. A linear kernel is a simple dot product between two input vectors, while a non-linear kernel is a more complex function that can capture more intricate patterns in the data. The choice of kernel depends on the data's characteristics and the task's complexity.\nHyperparameters:SVR has severalhyperparametersthat you can adjust to control the behavior of the model. For example, the'C'parameter controls the trade-off between the insensitive loss and the sensitive loss. A larger value of'C'means that the model will try to minimize the insensitive loss more, while a smaller value of C means that the model will be more lenient in allowing larger errors.\nModel evaluation:Like anymachine learningmodel, it's important to evaluate the performance of an SVR model. One common way to do this is to split the data into a training set and a test set, and use the training set to fit the model and the test set to evaluate it. You can then use metrics likemean squared error (MSE)ormean absolute error (MAE)to measure the error between the predicted and true output values."

For ordinal variables, methods like ordinal encoding might be suitable, while for nominal variables, techniques like target encoding or one-hot encoding could be considered. Understanding the nature of the categorical variables in your dataset is crucial for selecting the most appropriate encoding method.\nHandling Missing Values During Encoding: Missing values within categorical variables pose a challenge during encoding. It's essential to decide how to handle these missing values before applying target encoding. Options include treating missing values as a separate category, imputing them with the mode or median, or using advanced imputation techniques. The chosen approach should align with the specific characteristics of the dataset and the objectives of the analysis.\nDealing with Rare or Unseen Categories: In real-world datasets, categorical variables may contain rare or unseen categories that were not present in the training data. Target encoding such categories based solely on the training set may lead to biased or unreliable results. To address this issue, consider techniques such as frequency thresholding or combining rare categories into a single group. Additionally, incorporating domain knowledge or external data sources can aid in properly handling rare categories during encoding.\nPreventing Overfitting and Data Leakage: Overfitting and data leakage are significant concerns when using target encoding within nested cross-validation. To mitigate these risks, ensure that the encoding is performed solely on the training folds during cross-validation. This prevents information from the validation set from influencing the encoding process, leading to more reliable model evaluation. By adhering to this practice, the model can generalize better to unseen data and provide more accurate performance estimates."

Their inherent simplicity, however, might lead to challenges when dealing with very complex or nuanced text data, leading practitioners to explore more sophisticated or ensemble methods for improvement."

Text Representation:\nBefore applying logistic regression text data should be converted as numerical features known astext vectorization.\nCommon techniques for text vectorization includeBag of Words (BoW),Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), or more advanced methods like word embeddings (Word2Vec,GloVe) or deep learning-based embeddings.\n2. Feature Extraction:\nOnce data is represented numerically, these representations can be used as features for model.\nFeatures could be the counts of words in BoW, the weighted values in TF-IDF, or the numerical vectors in embeddings.\n3. Logistic Regression Model:\nLogistic Regression models the relationship between the features and the probability of belonging to a particular class using the logistic function.\nThe logistic function (also called the sigmoid function) maps any real-valued number into the range [0, 1], which is suitable for representing probabilities.\nThe logistic regression model calculates a weighted sum of the input features and applies the logistic function to obtain the probability of belonging to the positive class."

These algorithms are specific to a particular problem e.g. Google Self Driving car, AlphaGo where a bot competes with humans and even itself to get better and better performers in Go Game. Each time we feed in data, they learn and add the data to their knowledge which is training data. So, the more it learns the better it gets trained and hence experienced.\nHere are some of most common reinforcement learning algorithms:\nQ-learning:Q-learning is a model-free RL algorithm that learns a Q-function, which maps states to actions. The Q-function estimates the expected reward of taking a particular action in a given state.\nSARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action):SARSA is another model-free RL algorithm that learns a Q-function. However, unlike Q-learning, SARSA updates the Q-function for the action that was actually taken, rather than the optimal action.\nDeep Q-learning:Deep Q-learning is a combination of Q-learning and deep learning. Deep Q-learning uses a neural network to represent the Q-function, which allows it to learn complex relationships between states and actions.\nLet's understand it with the help of examples.\nExample:Consider that you are training anAIagent to play a game like chess. The agent explores different moves and receives positive or negative feedback based on the outcome. Reinforcement Learning also finds applications in which they learn to perform tasks by interacting with their surroundings.\nThere are two main types of reinforcement learning:\nPositive reinforcement\nRewards the agent for taking a desired action.\nEncourages the agent to repeat the behavior.\nExamples: Giving a treat to a dog for sitting, providing a point in a game for a correct answer.\nNegative reinforcement\nRemoves an undesirable stimulus to encourage a desired behavior.\nDiscourages the agent from repeating the behavior.\nExamples: Turning off a loud buzzer when a lever is pressed, avoiding a penalty by completing a task.\nIt has autonomous decision-making that is well-suited for tasks and that can learn to make a sequence of decisions, like robotics and game-playing.\nThis technique is preferred to achieve long-term results that are very difficult to achieve.\nIt is used to solve a complex problems that cannot be solved by conventional techniques.\nTraining Reinforcement Learning agents can be computationally expensive and time-consuming.\nReinforcement learning is not preferable to solving simple problems.\nIt needs a lot of data and a lot of computation, which makes it impractical and costly.\nHere are some applications of reinforcement learning:\nGame Playing: RL can teach agents to play games, even complex ones.\nRobotics: RL can teach robots to perform tasks autonomously.\nAutonomous Vehicles: RL can help self-driving cars navigate and make decisions.\nRecommendation Systems: RL can enhance recommendation algorithms by learning user preferences.\nHealthcare: RL can be used to optimize treatment plans and drug discovery.\nNatural Language Processing (NLP): RL can be used in dialogue systems and chatbots.\nFinance and Trading: RL can be used for algorithmic trading.\nSupply Chain and Inventory Management: RL can be used to optimize supply chain operations.\nEnergy Management: RL can be used to optimize energy consumption.\nGame AI: RL can be used to create more intelligent and adaptive NPCs in video games.\nAdaptive Personal Assistants: RL can be used to improve personal assistants.\nVirtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR):RL can be used to create immersive and interactive experiences.\nIndustrial Control: RL can be used to optimize industrial processes.\nEducation: RL can be used to create adaptive learning systems.\nAgriculture: RL can be used to optimize agricultural operations."

Some of the most common ones include:\nGraph-based semi-supervised learning:This approach uses a graph to represent the relationships between the data points. The graph is then used to propagate labels from the labeled data points to the unlabeled data points.\nLabel propagation:This approach iteratively propagates labels from the labeled data points to the unlabeled data points, based on the similarities between the data points.\nCo-training:This approach trains two different machine learning models on different subsets of the unlabeled data. The two models are then used to label each other's predictions.\nSelf-training:This approach trains a machine learning model on the labeled data and then uses the model to predict labels for the unlabeled data. The model is then retrained on the labeled data and the predicted labels for the unlabeled data.\nGenerative adversarial networks (GANs):GANs are a type of deep learning algorithm that can be used to generate synthetic data. GANs can be used to generate unlabeled data for semi-supervised learning by training two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator.\nIt leads to better generalization as compared tosupervised learning,as it takes both labeled and unlabeled data.\nCan be applied to a wide range of data.\nSemi-supervisedmethods can be more complex to implement compared to other approaches.\nIt still requires somelabeled datathat might not always be available or easy to obtain.\nThe unlabeled data can impact the model performance accordingly.\nHere are some common applications of semi-supervised learning:\nImage Classification and Object Recognition: Improve the accuracy of models by combining a small set of labeled images with a larger set of unlabeled images.\nNatural Language Processing (NLP): Enhance the performance of language models and classifiers by combining a small set of labeled text data with a vast amount of unlabeled text.\nSpeech Recognition:Improve the accuracy of speech recognition by leveraging a limited amount of transcribed speech data and a more extensive set of unlabeled audio.\nRecommendation Systems: Improve the accuracy of personalized recommendations by supplementing a sparse set of user-item interactions (labeled data) with a wealth of unlabeled user behavior data.\nHealthcare and Medical Imaging: Enhance medical image analysis by utilizing a small set of labeled medical images alongside a larger set of unlabeled images."

How well this line captures the trend in the data depends on the complexity of the model you use.\nWhen a model is too simple, like fitting a straight line to curved data, it hashigh biasand fails to capture the true relationship, leading tounderfitting. For example, a linear model cannot represent a non-linear increase in house prices with size.\nHowever, if the model becomes too complex, like a fourth-degree polynomial that adjusts to every point, it developshigh variance, overfits the training data, and struggles to generalize to new data. This isoverfitting, where the model performs well on training but poorly on testing.\nAn ideal model strikes a balance withlow bias and low variance, capturing the overall pattern without overreacting to noise.

    "input": "What is a DeepFake?",
    "output": "DeepFake usesDeep Learning, a subset ofMachine Learning, to create videos that look real but are actually fake. It is basically a technology that can replace the face of a person in an image or a video with so much precision that it looks real. Or it can make a person say something on a video that they never actually said in real life. \"What you see is what you get\" is no longer true on the internet because of DeepFakes. And that is how you can see Jon Snow blaming the last season of Game of Thrones when this never actually happened!"
  },
  {
    "input": "How DeepFakes Are Made?",
    "output": "Aneural network algorithmknown as anautoencodercan be used for creating DeepFakes which attach a fake face to an original face. Suppose you want to attach the face of Jon Snow to Tyrion Lannister. To do that you take thousands of collected photos of both Jon and Tyrion and run them through a neural network called anencoder. This encoder will study the facial features in both faces and compress the images into the standard features they both have.\nThen a neural network called adecoderwill take these compressed images and recover the face of Jon. Similarly, another decoder will do this for Tyrion. To get Jon's face on Tyrion's face, all you have to do is take a compressed image of Jon's face and feed it into the decoder that was trained on images of Tyrion.\nSo, this decoder will reconstruct Tyrion's face but it will use all the mannerisms and expressions that appear on Jon's face. This has to be done on every image frame in a video to show Tyrion Lannister actually looking like Jon Snow, which is very weird to imagine! Another method to create DeepFakes uses aGenerative Adversarial Network(GAN).\nThis basically involves two neural networks that are known as theGeneratorand theDiscriminatorrespectively. The Generator creates fake images using a data set of existing real images like celebrities. Then the Discriminator tries to catch any defects in the generated images. The fake images created by the Generator at the beginning are obviously fake and don't even look like faces but with multiple passes, a real-looking fake image can be created.\nThis is a classic case of \"Fake it till you make it!\". In fact, it is even easier to create fake images if there is a large training data set of images already available. That is why celebrities and famous people are targeted the most. They have the most images and videos out in public."
  },
  {
    "input": "How DeepFakes Work?",
    "output": "As discussed above, Deepfakes replicate the data of faces and expressions which cannot be easily identified by a human eye. Whereas, GAN produces data that learns from deep learning and uses generators and discriminators.\nToday there are apps likeDeepFaceLabthat learn by themselves from the provided inputs along with the facial expressions layer by layer and accordingly manipulate the data. In short, it can also be considered as a video editor tool that can be masked with the original video and replace the desired faces.\nAlthough it will take some more time for accuracy it is heavily being used in movies and entertainment industries. Besides this, marketers are also trying to experiment with different promotional content without hiring any models/actors. You may also find some minor project apps that are based on Deepfakes technology which can be used to swap faces and do create some funny videos."

This makes a clear indication thatdeepfakes are a potential threat to cybersecurity.\nTo handle such threats governments of different countries have made laws against this technology so that it cannot be used for the wrong purpose. In 2019, WIPO (Word Intellectual Property Organization) submitted a draft that addresses thedeepfakes issue and the measure to handle the challenges."

  {
    "input": "How Do You Do DeepFakes?",
    "output": "As discussed above,deepfakes run on neural network type(autoencoder) which decreases the image's latent space and reconstructs it from the provided input. In this, the AI trains itself on how the manipulation has to be done and then copies the elements of the key features such as facial expressions, posture, etc. The processing is being done in frames for each element like talking, iris movement, body action, etc.\nFor such activity, a large set of data is being fed into the deepfakes so that their AI-based algorithm start processing which later converts the desired output into two chunks i.e.motion estimator and video generator."

Jon Snow apologizing for Game of Thrones is one such example! DeepFakes have also been used in films. One example is when Harrison Ford's young face was inserted onto Han Solo's face in Solo: A Star Wars Story.\nBut more and more, DeepFakes are being used maliciously. According to an estimate,at least 96% of DeepFakes online are pornographic in naturewhere images of celebrities or other famous women are mapped on the faces of porn stars.\nThis is a serious threat to many women. Anotherfuture threat of DeepFakes is the loss of trust. It is becoming more and more difficult to identify if a photo or video is real or fake. In this situation, it would become very difficult to trust anything as the truth. This can have huge ramifications. For example, courts would not be able to identify if a piece of evidence is real or fake in cases.\nAlso, security systems that rely on facial or voice recognition could also be tricked using DeepFakes in the future.

The most common sign is that the ears, teeth, and eyes of the person do not match the face outline sometimes. Lip syncing in the video may also be wrong and it is very difficult to create individual strands of hair in DeepFakes. And if the face appears too smooth to be real, chances are it's not real but a DeepFake.\nHowever, it is getting more and more difficult to spot DeepFakes as they are looking more and more real with advances in technology. In such a situation,only Artificial Intelligence can recognize the use of Artificial Intelligence in photos and videos. Almost all big tech companies are investing in creatingtechnology that can identify DeepFakes.\nOne of the biggest efforts in this is the Deepfake Detection Challenge by Amazon, Microsoft, and Facebook which aims to identify fake content on the internet (which is getting more and more difficult to do!) Hopefully, all these measures will be enough tospot DeepFakes in the future. Otherwise, there may come a time when funny videos about Jon Snow would be the least of the DeepFake problems in this world. And even international catastrophes may happen because of the fake news spread by DeepFakes."

This generates diverse data views, reducing overfitting and improving model generalization.\nBase Model Training:Each bootstrap sample trains an independent base learner (e.g., decision trees, SVMs, neural networks). These “weak learners” may not perform well alone but contribute to ensemble strength. Training happens in parallel, making bagging efficient.\nAggregation: Once trained, each base model generates predictions on new data. For classification, predictions are combined via majority voting; for regression, predictions are averaged to produce the final outcome.\nOut-of-Bag (OOB) Evaluation: Samples excluded from a particular bootstrap subset (called out-of-bag samples) provide a natural validation set for that base model. OOB evaluation offers an unbiased performance estimate without additional cross-validation.\nBagging starts with the original training dataset.\nFrom this, bootstrap samples (random subsets with replacement) are created. These samples are used to train multiple weak learners, ensuring diversity.\nEach weak learner independently predicts outcomes, capturing different patterns.\nPredictions are aggregated using majority voting, where the most voted output becomes the final classification.\nOut-of-Bag (OOB) evaluation measures model performance using data not included in each bootstrap sample.\nOverall, this approach improves accuracy and reduces overfitting."
